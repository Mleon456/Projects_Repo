# Project2 - Social App

Revature Social Application!

## For Devs!

**Make sure you clone outside of our 2015-may24 Repo! This is very important and could cause problems later!**

```
dolso@DESKTOP-K1SO99G MINGW64 ~/Desktop/RevProject2
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/deolson1/project2-social-app.git
Cloning into 'project2-social-app'...

dolso@DESKTOP-K1SO99G MINGW64 ~/Desktop/RevProject2
$ cd project2-social-app/
```

After you have cloned the repo and cd'ed into it you have (dev)
Now we want to make our own branches, run the following:

    git checkout -b YOUR_NAME_HERE

The -b will create the branch if none exists.
I've locked the main branch so that we can try our best to implement good workflow strategies, our general commits will look like 

```
dolso@DESKTOP-K1SO99G MINGW64 ~/Desktop/RevProject2/project2-social-app (david)
$ git add .

dolso@DESKTOP-K1SO99G MINGW64 ~/Desktop/RevProject2/project2-social-app (david)
$ git commit -m "adding my own branch and a readme img"

dolso@DESKTOP-K1SO99G MINGW64 ~/Desktop/RevProject2/project2-social-app (david)
$ git push origin YOUR_NAME_HERE
```

We can then merge our individual branches onto dev when needed
